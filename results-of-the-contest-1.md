To determine the top three winners, each of the six multisig signatories independently and secretly from the others compiled a list of their seven favorite artworks, ranking them from most liked to least liked. Afterwards, each list was encrypted by its creator, and the hash was posted in the #spawn thread of our Discord server to record the choice and prove its immutability later on (the hash corresponds to a specific character order, and no other order will match this hash).

The first place in each list is awarded seven points, the second place gets six points, and so forth. In the end, the points are summed up to identify the winners.
