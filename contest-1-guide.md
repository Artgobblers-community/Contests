# Guide for Participation in Contest #1

## Step 1
To participate in the contest, you will need a blank page (you can send up to three pages to participate in the contest). If your address is listed [here](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/active-members-list.txt) or you are an owner of an [Artgobblers NFT ](https://opensea.io/collection/artgobblers) you can get three free pages to participate in the contest (or three invites, more details below). 
The number of free pages available for the community is limited to three hundred, and the counter of available pages is [here](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/available-pages.md).
To get free pages, send a DM on X/Twitter [@artgobs](https://twitter.com/artgobs) or post about it in the #spawn thread on the Artgobblers Discord server.

If your address is not on the list, and you are not an owner of an Artgobblers NFT, you can purchase blank pages on NFT marketplaces, for example, [blur](https://blur.io/collection/pages?traits=%7B%22Glamination+Status%22%3A%5B%22Blank%22%5D%7D) or [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/pages?search[stringTraits][0][name]=Glamination%20Status&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=Blank) (current page price is $3-4). 
Or you can mint blank pages for GOO tokens on the official [website](https://artgobblers.com/dashboard) => "Create Blank Page" button. Otherwise, here are [the instructions for purchasing GOO](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/goo-guide.md).

Or you can request a free blank page/invite, details in the "About invites" section at the end of this article.

## Step 2

After you have received the invites or pages, start drawing! Go to the [artgobblers.com](https://artgobblers.com/) and click the "connect" button to connect your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask). Confirm the action.

![artgobbles.com](https://gyazo.com/1c21cbab50c33c9b16a4c4b047ad8f4b.png)

Follow the link from the invite or simply click the "draw" button.

![draw](https://gyazo.com/c0e351e6e14198e974fa58bba28c4dc8.png)

You will have standard tools such as layers, fill, and brush, and two thousand steps to create a drawing.

Don’t forget to name your drawing!

After you finish, click the "Preview and share" button.

If you had an invite, copy the link like artgobblers.com/drawing/T7W3N63 (in this way you can send up to three drawings) and send it in a DM on Twitter to the account @artgobs.

In this case, no further actions are required from you, you are participating in the contest!

By the way, you can see all your drawings by [the link](https://artgobblers.com/drafts), and there you can also connect your Twitter account. Recently glaminated drawings by other Artgobblers artists can be found at [the gallery](https://artgobblers.com/gallery).

## Step 3

Go to your account on the [OpenSea marketplace](https://opensea.io) and connect your wallet. Then go to your [collection](https://opensea.io/account/collected) and find your page there.
If it doesn’t have a drawing on it and looks like this:

![blank page](https://gyazo.com/2980c419521bff259885620502a997f8.png)

click on it, on the page that opens click the three dots in the upper right corner 

![dots](https://gyazo.com/254836a08b1df6e2df71c5bd8aa282dd.png)

and click the refresh metadata button.

![refresh](https://gyazo.com/0e210a367d950be4f26640e8eaa4cf4b.png)

After some time, your NFT will be updated, and a drawing will appear. Now you have a glaminated page!

## Step 4

Send the page to participate in the contest (you can send up to three glaminated pages).
For this, go back to your collection on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/account/collected) and hover over the page of interest. 

![page](https://gyazo.com/9c604b02bb70c0c203abfb5d7bf20d7d.png)

In the pop-up menu, click the three dots => select.

![select](https://gyazo.com/e6769feff66370ca46570b2bf4eeecaf.png)

Select in this way up to three pages

![select](https://gyazo.com/409987ebd4d785211c2c8ebd314abb11.png)

Click the "Transfer" button at the bottom of the page

![transfer](https://gyazo.com/72baeaf5ce603433e3ce58f620ab1056.png)

Copy the community wallet address `0x1C37968ea6CB96adebEeB6344dAc1646Ffb8C15f` (be careful!) and paste it into the respective field.

![transfer](https://gyazo.com/cb7e65a393679f78b89dff4ad5299dba.png)

Click the "transfer X items" button.

Remember, your crypto wallet must have a little ETH to complete the transfer (about $3). Also, you may need to approve OpenSea to spend your pages, which could result in a few more dollars in fees. Confirm the transaction in your crypto wallet. 
Now you are participating in the contest! Great!

## About invites

- If you are entitled to three free pages as a Gobbler owner or active artist, instead of three NFT pages, you can request three invites to participate in the contest. This will save you from having to spend ETH on sending NFTs to the community multisig. Each issued invite reduces the number of free pages available [here](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/available-pages.md). To request invites, you need to do the same as when obtaining pages - message [@artgobs](https://twitter.com/artgobs) or [@visavi_eth](https://twitter.com/visavi_eth) on Twitter/DM.

- If you are not entitled to free pages/invites (or someone among your acquaintances who is an artist) and want to participate in our contest but cannot afford to purchase a blank page on the secondary market, or if you do not have ETH to pay the fee for sending NFTs to the contest, or if you (or your acquaintance artist) do not have a crypto wallet at all, you can request one free invite to participate in the contest. For this, send a DM on Twitter to [@artgobs](https://twitter.com/artgobs) or [@visavi_eth](https://twitter.com/visavi_eth). Invites issued this way also reduce the number of available free pages.

However, keep in mind that in the future, for identification as the author and for receiving prizes, you will need to obtain a crypto address, for example, by installing a web wallet like MetaMask.

And don't forget about our [retweet contest!](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/retweet-contest-1-guide.md)

Good luck!
