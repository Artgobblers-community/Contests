Now you have GOO, which you can deposit into the vault a# Guide to Obtaining GOO

GOO is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It's part of the gameplay mechanics of the Artgobblers ecosystem and is necessary for minting new Artgobblers or new blank pages. Each Gobbler you hold generates GOO token, the higher the Gobbler's multiplier, the more GOO it produces. The more Gobblers you store in your Ethereum address, the higher their total multiplier and the more GOO you store, the more GOO your storage produces.

For more detailed information about this token, you can find [an article](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/goo) from Paradigm.

An important note: there is no point in buying the token and holding it in hopes of appreciation, because this token has massive inflation and its price will always trend toward zero. But if you also have a gobbler, your address will generate new GOO, and holding it will make sense.

The only reasons you might want to buy GOO are the desire to increase the production of GOO in combination with your Gobbler, or the desire to mint a Gobbler or blank pages.

Remember, the current cost to mint a Gobbler exceeds 300k GOO, and the current cost to mint a blank page is over 1k GOO.

In this article, we will show ways to acquire GOO:

## 1st Method

If you buy an Artgobbler NFT, GOO will start generating from zero automatically, and to view the generation rates, you need to visit [the factory](https://artgobblers.com/factory). The larger the multiplier of your Gobbler (x6, x7, x8, x9, and above for legendary gobblers), or the higher the total multiplier of all your Gobblers, the higher the GOO generation rate from your storage will be.
However, this rate will still be negligible, and to increase your rate and place on the [leaderboard](https://artgobblers.dyor.fi/), you may need to acquire additional GOO.

You cannot go to Uniswap and try to buy GOO, because of the same massive inflation - it is not beneficial for anyone to supply liquidity in pair with this token that has an infinite supply and huge inflation. Therefore, there are no reasonable prices and sufficient liquidity to acquire this token on Uniswap.

But enthusiasts have created an interesting infrastructure around the protocol, giving us the following two methods (and even the possibility of arbitrage between them):

## 2nd Method

You can use the [Goodao](https://goodao.io/) protocol, which is currently the largest holder of GOO in the Artgobblers ecosystem.

For this, you need to purchase Wrapped GOO on Uniswap (contract `0x600d003FEbc6c2B503621060Cbd371dCe1C8EF1e`). You can verify this on [their GitHub](https://github.com/DaoGoo/Contracts).

To do this, you need to go to [uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/) 

![uni](https://gyazo.com/5ee00868866a5f4d081d857469658be5.png)

Then click the "select token" button and in the search name or paste address field insert the WGOO address `0x600d003FEbc6c2B503621060Cbd371dCe1C8EF1e`

![uni](https://gyazo.com/c2ed6e4fec4020e31141caf9a329698b.png)

Then click on the suggested token wGoo and enter the amount in ETH that you plan to spend on acquiring GOO.

Please note, the Uniswap warning about a 99% slippage does not reflect reality (but in any case, the liquidity for this pair is low).

![uni](https://gyazo.com/2cec899b16933c64dab0c6568759a142.png)

For this example, we took the amount of 0.089 ETH because that is the current floor price of an Artgobbler. Thus, we can buy 2.77409 wGOO for 0.089 ETH.

Then you need to visit the [goodao.io](https://goodao.io/), and at the top of the site, you will see the GOO/wGOO rate = 89589, which means that by unwrapping your wGOO, you will receive 2.77409 * 89589 = 248k GOO tokens (minus a 2% commission).

Next, you need to click the unwrap button, 

![goodao](https://gyazo.com/90bd399ff6a16fdb4eb84287db83529b.png)

press the max button, and confirm the transaction.

Now you have GOO, which you can deposit into the vault at [the factory](https://artgobblers.com/factory) (if you own a Gobbler) or use the GOO to mint Gobblers or blank pages.

## 3rd Method
For this, you need to use another protocol - [goober.xyz](https://goober.xyz/). 

![goober](https://gyazo.com/60a3e821718a617bcfc86b0d8b230fa1.png)

To get GOO this way, you need to purchase a Gobbler on the secondary market, for example, [Blur](https://blur.io/collection/artgobblers).
After making the purchase, go to the [goober.xyz](https://goober.xyz/) website, and on the right side of the page, click the double arrow, selecting the exchange direction gobbler => goo.

![goober](https://gyazo.com/b92799100004a7892e9b691eee19bf86.png)

Then select your gobbler and press the swap button, confirming the action in your wallet.

![goober](https://gyazo.com/ff622fc22d09408d2c090569b35e455f.png)

The amount of GOO you receive will directly depend on your gobbler's multiplier - if your gobbler has a multiplier of x6, currently you will receive 195k goo, if maximum (x9) - you will receive 291400 GOO.

Then the GOO can be deposited into [the vault](https://artgobblers.com/factory) or used to mint blank pages.

Note, if you buy a x6 gobbler on Blur right now and exchange it this way for GOO, it will be much less profitable than simply buying wGOO on Uniswap and converting it to GOO on the gooDAO site. But if you can buy a gobbler with a multiplier of x8 or x9 from the floor, goober.xyz becomes a more profitable option. But the downside of goober is the lower threshold in the form of the gobbler's floor price.

Also note that purchasing a Gobbler on the goober website is significantly more beneficial than minting a Gobbler on the official site. This is precisely what the "VRGDA Discount" label on the goober website refers to.

All of the above provides some arbitrage opportunities, think about them on your own.

Either way, acquiring GOO in conjunction with a Gobbler or obtaining GOO for page minting, Gobbler minting, or buying a Gobbler on goober may be more profitable than directly purchasing [a blank page](https://blur.io/collection/pages?traits=%7B%22Glamination+Status%22%3A%5B%22Blank%22%5D%7D) or Gobbler on NFT marketplaces. Everything depends on the market conditions and the floor price of pages and Gobblers, as well as the prices set by the decentralized markets goodao and goober.
