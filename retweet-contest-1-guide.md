# Guide for Participation in Retweet Contest #1

Three randomly selected winners will each receive 0.1 ETH (more than $300 each).

## To participate in the retweet contest, you need to:
* follow [@artgobs](https://twitter.com/artgobs) on X/Twitter;
* like [this post](https://twitter.com/artgobs/status/1783470320331948443) and repost it;
* indicate your ETH address in replies or direct messages to [@artgobs](https://twitter.com/artgobs)

To avoid abuse, we are forced to introduce one important criterion for participants:
* you must have at least one NFT token from the [Art Gobblers pages](https://blur.io/collection/pages) collection or [Art Gobblers](https://blur.io/collection/artgobblers) on your address. Alternatively, your address must be listed in this [list](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/active-members-list.txt)

To determine the winners, we will use the hash of an empty transaction from our multisig as a source of randomness.

Please note, we also use multipliers:

* If you simply own an NFT from the [Art Gobblers pages](https://blur.io/collection/pages) collection OR are on this [list](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/active-members-list.txt), you will have a x1 chance of winning;
* If you own an NFT [Art Gobblers](https://blur.io/collection/artgobblers), you will have a x2 chance of winning;
* If you own an NFT [Art Gobblers](https://blur.io/collection/artgobblers) AND are [listed](https://github.com/Artgobblers-community/Contests/blob/main/active-members-list.txt), you will have a x3 chance.
  
To get on the specified list, just participate in the contest, the conditions of which are announced in [the tweet](https://twitter.com/artgobs/status/1783470320331948443) you need to retweet.

This contest will last until approximately mid or end of May 2024.
